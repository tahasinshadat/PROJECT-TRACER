# PROJECT TRACER

### Overview
PROJECT-TRACER is an autonomous tunnel robot designed to address the challenges posed by emergency situations within tunnels. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and an array of sensors, this project was initially conceptualized and presented as a solution for the Port Authority Challenge. The primary goal is to detect emergencies within tunnel environments and establish a two-way communication system between authorities and civilians via a web server and network infrastructure.

### Problem Statement
Tunnels, due to their enclosed and often lengthy nature, pose unique challenges during emergency situations. Issues such as accidents, incidents, or unforeseen events can lead to heightened risks for both civilians and emergency response teams. The lack of effective communication channels, limited visibility, and the need for swift response and coordination compound the challenges faced during these critical scenarios.

Traditional tunnel monitoring and emergency response systems may lack the agility, real-time data access, and interactive communication necessary to effectively manage such situations. This project aims to bridge these gaps by developing an autonomous tunnel robot equipped with sophisticated AI algorithms and a comprehensive array of sensors to swiftly detect emergencies and establish seamless, bidirectional communication channels between authorities and individuals in distress.

### Features
* **AI-Powered Emergency Detection:** Utilizes advanced AI algorithms and sensor fusion to detect and analyze emergency situations within tunnel environments in real-time.
* **Two-Way Communication:** Enables seamless interaction between authorities and civilians through a web server and network infrastructure, facilitating quick response and coordination during emergencies.
* **Autonomous Navigation:** Capable of autonomous navigation within tunnels, ensuring comprehensive coverage and efficient emergency response without human intervention.
* **Sensors and Data Analysis:** Integrates various sensors for environmental monitoring, data collection, and analysis, providing critical insights for emergency response decision-making.

### Usage
PROJECT-TRACER is designed to be deployed within tunnels across New York City to enhance emergency response capabilities and ensure the safety of civilians and responders. Below are the steps for deploying and utilizing the system:
1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository to the designated hardware (Raspberry Pi, edge computing devices, etc.) intended for deployment within the tunnels.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository to set up the necessary dependencies and configurations.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Position the autonomous tunnel robot equipped with the PROJECT-TRACER system at strategic points within the tunnels, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
   - Power on the system and verify the initialization and connectivity with the network.

3. **Monitoring and Interaction:**
   - Access the system remotely through a web server interface provided by PROJECT-TRACER.
   - Monitor the real-time video feed and data insights generated by the system.
   - Initiate two-way communication between authorities and civilians in emergency situations using the established communication channels.

4. **Maintenance and Support:**
   - Regularly maintain and update the system to ensure optimal performance and responsiveness.
   - Provide necessary support and troubleshoot any issues that arise during operation.

#### Note:
- For detailed instructions on setup, configuration, and operational guidelines, refer to the documentation included in the repository.
- This system is intended for deployment in tunnel environments and should be managed by authorized personnel trained in emergency response protocols and system operation.
